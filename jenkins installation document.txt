INSTALLATION FOR JENKINS

Prerequisites
Pre-Install Ubuntu 24.04
Non-root user with sudo privileges
At least 2GB RAM or more
25 GB disk space
Internet Connectivity
✅ Step-by-Step: Install Jenkins on Ubuntu 24.04
Install Java (Jenkins requires Java):

sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk -y
Check Java version:
java -version
Add Jenkins repository key and source list:

curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
Install Jenkins:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins -y
Start and enable Jenkins:

sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
Check Jenkins status:

sudo systemctl status jenkins

 sudo ufw allow 8080
 
  sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

http://43.205.254.30:8080

  
 In the next step, select ‘Install suggested plugin‘ for simplicity’s sake.
 
 When the installation of plugins is complete, the installer will take you to the next section where you will be required to create an Admin user and click on the ‘Save and Continue’ button.
 The next step will populate the default URL for your Jenkin’s instance. No action is required, simply click ‘Save and Finish’.
 Finally, click on the ‘Start using Jenkins’ button to gain access to Jenkins dashboard.





###*********************************************************************************************##

if  you've forgotten your Jenkins username and password. To regain access, you can reset the Jenkins administrator password by temporarily disabling security, creating a new admin user, and then re-enabling security. Here's how you can do it:

1. Disable Security Temporarily:

Stop Jenkins Service:
sudo systemctl stop Jenkins

This command stops the Jenkins service to allow configuration changes.

Edit the Jenkins Configuration File:

sudo nano /var/lib/jenkins/config.xml

Replace /var/lib/jenkins/ with your Jenkins home directory if it's different.

Locate the <useSecurity> tag.

Change its value from true to false:

<useSecurity>false</useSecurity>

Save the file and exit the editor.
2. Restart Jenkins Service:

sudo systemctl start jenkins
This command restarts Jenkins with security disabled.

3. Access Jenkins Web Interface:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://15.206.170.147:8080.
